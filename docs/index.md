# Factions<small>UUID</small>

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have the latest version from the [resource page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsuuid.1035/).

FactionsUUID supports versions of Minecraft as far back as 1.8.8, from one plugin jar.

    Visit the [support page](help.md) for more information on assistance.

## Temporary Plugin Support: Factions Top

Looking for a version of Factions Top by Novucs that works with the latest FactionsUUID? We have a working fork
available [here](https://github.com/CmdrKittens/factions-top/releases/download/temp/FactionsTop.jar).

All credit for the plugin itself goes to Novucs, who released his work under the MIT license. Once they update
their plugin with the fix we have submitted (or their own equivalent fix), we'll remove this link.

## Translation

You can translate most FactionsUUID messages to your own language by editing `lang.yml`

## Under Construction
