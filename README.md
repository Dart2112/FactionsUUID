## About FactionsUUID
This plugin will allow the players on the server to create factions/guilds. The factions can claim territory
that will be protected from non-members. Factions can forge alliances and declare themselves enemies with others.
Land may be taken from other factions through war.

The goals of this plugin:

* The players should be able to take care of anti-griefing themselves.
* Inspire politics and intrigue on your server.
* Guild formation and team spirit! :)

## Open
This repository is open because all Bukkit-derived plugins should follow the GPLv3 and this repo further enables
the open-source spirit upon which this community was built!

I'd appreciate it if you could [pay for the plugin](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsuuid.1035/) if your
server makes money. If you only run your server for your kids or some friends and don't make any money,
then I don't want to stop you from doing so by forcing you to buy a plugin. If that's the case,
then just open a ticket on Discord, and we can work something out.
